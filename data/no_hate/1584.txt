An honour to meet so many dedicated aid workers here. This is Mitun from @BRACworld whoâ€™d recently attended training on child protection provided by @theIRC. Building up specialist refugee protection expertise within national NGOs is part of our work here. #aidworks #rohingya https://t.co/s2byExUBss
