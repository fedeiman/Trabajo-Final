Volunteer Info Sessions give an overview of the U.S. resettlement  process, services which are or aren't provided to refugees, and what it is like to volunteer with us. This event is open to anyone interested in volunteering with World Relief Chicago. Sign up for this Saturday! https://t.co/8st7j8GmZJ
