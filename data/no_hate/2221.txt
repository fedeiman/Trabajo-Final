Uh. Hi. I'm an anarchist, and my mother is an immigrant who because of her immigration doesn't have the same job opportunies and nowhere near the money for a trust fund. Also my dad was a farmer who taught himself because he couldn't go to school. Keep your B.S. off my TL thanks. https://t.co/0rtxG1KzcD
