It's #WorldRefugeeDay.  For FY2018 the refugee admissions cap is at a historic low of only 45,000, divided among 5 regions of the world. After 2/3 of a year, the  U.S. has only admitted 14,300 #refugees or 32% of the total. @IIRGMU @ilctr @Aldo_Bello @AlexNowrasteh @CabreraAngel https://t.co/pHWjKUKqtt
