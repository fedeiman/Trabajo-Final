Great idea! BUT: Frequent flyer miles can be incredibly expensive to donate (almost as expensive as the tickets themselves). Would @AmericanAir, @united, @SouthwestAir, @JetBlue, @Delta, &amp; @VirginAmerica agree to waive fees for donating miles for immigrant reunification efforts? https://t.co/NPNLZyMxiw
