Home is the place we live, grow up and put roots down. Not somewhere else, not the next county, not some other town. Deportation, forced to go long way away, is just redefining people as homeless refugees at the end of the day. "Home" will never be defined by bureaucracy, nay! https://t.co/8wO89O6LRs
