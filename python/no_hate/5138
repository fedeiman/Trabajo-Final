@soniandtv @SushmaSwaraj @nsitharaman I don't feel fantastic to see them in this position..Do they speak up when rape and assault on women takes place..When men from their own party rape women.. What's the use of holding that position if u can't speak for women.. Cunning politicians..Only power matters to them
