Churches in Scotland! Have you seen @WithRefugees's theological reflection on migration? It's great! And don't forget that we're also happy to come to speak to your congregation or community group about our work at RST - we are so grateful to the many faith groups who support us. https://t.co/UYyRTclRGA
