It does not matter who you are, old or young, rich or poor, male or female, left or right, citizen or immigrant, NOBODY should be subjected to this kind of treatment while incarcerated, least of all children.   This is not a matter of politics, it is a matter of human dignity. https://t.co/sykhaGkCF0
