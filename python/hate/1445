Ok, I am asking out of curiosity. Lets suppose a group of immigrant in Netherlands started fighting &amp; killing local security forces and requested that they want some land to form their own government. In your logic, those aren't terrorrists? &amp; sec. forces are legitimate targets? https://t.co/3UgIggTDkH
