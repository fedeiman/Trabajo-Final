#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	The US was always a multi-cultured country populated by immigrants. That is part of the identity of the US and most families come from immigrant families. There is no replacement of US culture. All the contrary, US culture is enriched by diversity

#2	AnnotatorNotes T5	Why do you claim there is an invasion? Is there an army invading the US? Are you claiming that this army is going to impose 5 de Mayo as the oficial national holiday? It seems crazy, honestly

#3	AnnotatorNotes T6	Usually migrants acquire culture from the country they migrate a lot more than locals acquire culture from immigrants. Do you have any proof that Cinco de Mayo is displacing 4th of July?
