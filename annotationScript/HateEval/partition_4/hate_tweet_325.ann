T1	Premise2Justification 0 263	Spoken like a true globalist. A borderless, one world government has always been their goal. No borders means social mayhem. The more chaos they foment, the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate. Ordo ab chao (out of chaos, order) is their motto.

#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	So we need to build the wall not because of the immigrants but to fight the globalists and avoid falling into a distopia where there is one super oppresive global superstate? And immigrants are part of this plan too? Are you sure you're taking your meds?

#2	AnnotatorNotes T6	Really? You think immigrants are brought by "the globalists" to foment chaos and social mayhem as part of a secret plan to create a superstate? Chaos and social mayhem is not on immigrants to blame but on the xenophobous and intolerant people full of hate suh as yourself
